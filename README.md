> *August 2019 - Update from the author*: I spent over a decade working on Podcast Generator in my spare time. PG is currently used by [tens of thousands of podcasters](https://www.google.com/search?q="powered+by+podcast+generator"). The software is still stable and it does not present any known security issue, however, it does need immediate maintainance and substantial improvements. Due to lack of time, [I'm looking for someone to take over the project](https://twitter.com/albertobeta/status/1160141717531713536). Feel free to reach out via email: alberto@betella.net
